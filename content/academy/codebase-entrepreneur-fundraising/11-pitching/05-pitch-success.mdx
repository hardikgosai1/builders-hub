  <p>"It's important to create a deck that is simple in its language and where you've reflected on the value of each and every word. People tend to stuff lots of highly technical information into their deck and way of speaking. This makes presentations very heavy."</p>

Preparation is the most critical part of your performance when it comes to pitching. Before your presentation, use this anchoring process:
- Identify the key topic per segment, distilling each to a single word
- Connect personally by asking: Why does this matter to me?
- Choose an intentional energy level for each section
- Center yourself by asking "Why am I here today?" and use your answer as a speaking foundation

For five-minute pitches (common in accelerator programs like Codebase):
- Create a deck for a five-minute pitch that is complete enough to get the relevant information across, while being as minimal as possible; containing cue words that trigger script memory.
- Memorize your script thoroughly and practice until delivery feels natural
- Edit ruthlessly—less information with more impact is better
- Strategically set up questions you want to be asked during Q&A

Don't neglect Q&A preparation. Research jury members and their likely question styles, practice handling both easy and difficult questions with your team, and prepare for expertise gaps and technical deep-dives.
