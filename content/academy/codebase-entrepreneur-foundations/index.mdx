Our speakers are seasoned founders and Avalanche experts who offer hard-earned lessons, strategic insights, and practical frameworks that go far beyond surface-level advice. You will gain direct access to the kind of knowledge and mentorship rarely shared publicly — the real alpha that can make the difference between a stalled idea and a successful venture. If you're serious about launching a Web3 business, this is where your journey begins.

These three modules are designed to give you a strong foundation for building and scaling your startup with confidence. You’ll begin by setting up your company on solid ground, mastering the essential legal, financial, compliance, and security principles that safeguard your business. From there, you’ll learn to shape and refine your vision through the Business Model Canvas, ensuring your strategy is both sustainable and customer-focused. Finally, you’ll dive deep into understanding the people who matter most—your stakeholders and users—by identifying their needs, creating personas, and translating insights into impactful solutions. Together, these modules equip you with the practical tools to launch, grow, and sustain a successful venture.
