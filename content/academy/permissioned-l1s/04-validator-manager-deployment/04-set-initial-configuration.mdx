import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/toolbox/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx"
import Initialize from "@/components/toolbox/console/permissioned-l1s/validator-manager-setup/Initialize.tsx"

Setting the initial configuration is a critical step that establishes how your Validator Manager will operate. 

This process involves calling the `initialize` function through the **TransparentUpgradeableProxy**, which forwards the call to your ValidatorManager implementation.

## How Initialization Works

### The Initialize Function

The configuration is set by calling `initialize()` with a `ValidatorManagerSettings` struct. This call:
- Goes through the proxy at `0xfacade...` (not directly to the implementation)
- Can only be called once due to OpenZeppelin's `initializer` modifier
- Sets up the ownership structure and operational parameters

## Configuration Parameters

The `ValidatorManagerSettings` struct contains four essential parameters:

1. **Admin Address**: The account that controls validator management operations (your connected wallet). Can be changed through ownership transfer.
2. **Subnet ID**: Links the Validator Manager to your specific L1 & can't be changed after initialization.
3. **Churn Period Seconds**:Time window for tracking validator set changes (must be ≤ 86400 seconds)
4. **Maximum Churn Percentage**: Limits how much validator weight can change per period (1-20% protocol maximum). 
*Example*: 20% means max 1/5 of total weight can change

## Set Configuration

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="l1">
    <Initialize />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>
