import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "@/components/academy/wrapper/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx"
import ReadContract from "@/components/console/tools/permissioned-l1s/validator-manager-setup/ReadContract.tsx"

Here you can double check that the `ValidatorManager` contract has been deployed and initialized correctly.

Specifically, you can check the `totalWeight`, `admin`, `subnetID`, `churnPeriodSeconds`, and `maximumChurnPercentage` variables.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper  walletMode="l1">
    <ReadContract />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>
