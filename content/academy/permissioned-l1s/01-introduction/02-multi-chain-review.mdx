## Subnets/L1s vs Chains

It's important to understand that a **Subnet or L1** is a validator set, while a **chain** is an individual blockchain instance:

- **Subnet/L1**: A group of validators that can validate multiple blockchains
- **Chain**: A single blockchain validated by exactly one Subnet

While technically one Subnet can validate multiple chains (like the Primary Network validating P-Chain, C-Chain, and X-Chain), **in production it's almost always a 1:1 relationship**, and we strongly recommend keeping it as such for:
- **Simpler management**
- **Resource isolation**: Each application gets dedicated validator resources, and in the scenario that multiple validators go done, at least only one chain will be affected.  

## Subnets

Subnets are blockchains validated by a *subset of Primary Network validators*. 

Key technical characteristics:
- Validators must be Primary Network validators (2,000 AVAX stake requirement)
- Validators sync and validate the entire Primary Network (X, P, C chains) - takes longer to sync
- Validator set is constrained to existing Primary Network participants

## L1s

L1s are blockchains with *sovereign validator sets* independent of the Primary Network.

Key technical characteristics:
- Validators form their own independent validator set
- Validators pay continuous fees (~1.33 AVAX/month)
- Validators only sync the P-Chain, not the entire Primary Network (faster synce time)
- No dependency on Primary Network validator participation

In the [Subnet Creation](/academy/permissioned-l1s/01-introduction/03-create-subnet.mdx) section we will cover how to create an Subnet using [Avalanche's Developer Console](https://build.avax.network/tools/l1-toolbox). To learn more about this architecture transition and the ACPs that enabled it, check out the [ETNA upgrade](/academy/etna-upgrade).
